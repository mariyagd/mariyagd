### Hi there 👋

I'm a computer enthusiast and a student at École 42 in Lausanne (Switzerland) 🎓. Always eager to learn and take on new challenges 💪. My unconventional journey has taken me into programming, and I'm now immersed in the world of software development and artificial intelligence 🤖. On GitHub, you'll find my projects in C and C++, as well as my learning experiences and exploration of new languages and technologies 💻. Feel free to explore my profile and reach out to me for any collaboration or mutual learning opportunities 🚀. See you soon! 😊
